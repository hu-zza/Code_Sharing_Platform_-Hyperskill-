# Code_Sharing_Platform_-Hyperskill-
  
#### Core: Spring Boot (MVC, Data), JPA, Thymeleaf
  
---  
  
A project from JetBrains Academy:  
  
## About  
  
There is a lot of collaboration in programming: many projects require sharing your code with other developers. Using open web resources such as Pastebin is not always an option. In this project, you will create your own secure version of a code-sharing platform.
  
## Learning outcomes  
  
You will get acquainted with server development on Spring Boot and touch on some basic topics in Web-programming such as HTML, CSS, and JS.

## Extra stuff

This project used to work with [Apache FreeMarker](https://freemarker.apache.org/), but I migrate it to [Thymeleaf](https://www.thymeleaf.org/).  
In addition, it has got a nice, dark, responsive design with [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).
